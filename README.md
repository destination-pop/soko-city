# Soko-City: A Puzzle Adventure Game

Soko-City is an RPG adventure game featuring Sokoban puzzles, level progression, and randomly-generated inventory and terrain. We built the game out programmatically so that the levels can continue indefinitely. Our current game features five dynamic levels. Play at https://soko-city.firebaseapp.com/

**Motivation**

Our group wanted to build an visually-pleasing but robust puzzle adventure game, inspired loosely by games like Stardew Valley. We liked the idea of incorporating a Japanese Sokoban puzzle into a larger themed adventure. And so Soko-City was born.
